# LotteryApplication 🍀
My first Java application that I made 100% by myself from scratch as a currently studying career changer

### What was my motivation ? 
I've always liked to be a conscious gambler, some people just play the same tickets every week, while others likes to build up a tactic and play by it.
This application helps to rethink your tactic with more kind of analysis.

### What this application do ? 
+ Reads the newest data from the official Ötöslottó's HTML page and stores them in a database.📃
+ Can read specific draws by inserting the draw's date or can read between two intervals.📝
+ Can find the biggest prizes ever won.🔍
+ Prints out analysis.📊
+ Simulates what if you would've played a fix-ticket tactic over the years. (Not available yet, I keep upgrading my app)💻

### Installation 🔧
Set up a database named "drawsOfOtoslotto",
Replace user, password, connection in resources/sql.properties,
*I will write a setup method that will sets up the tables after that, currently thats not included, just realized that 
would've be very helpful when starting the application first time.*
